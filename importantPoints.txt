This populate is used to embedd the data without actually existing in the database
.populate({
    path: 'guides',
    select: '-__v -passwordChangedAt',
  });

2) We can get access to all the reviews for a certain tour,but without keeping this array of ID's on the tour.
So, think of 'Virtual Populate' like a way
of keeping that array of review ID's on a tour,
but without actually persisting it to the database.
And so that then solves the problem that we have
with child referencing

Instead of this:-
 reviews: [
      {
        type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Review',
      },
    ],

Use this:

tourSchema.virtual('reviews', {
  ref: 'Review',
  foreignField: 'tour',
  localField: '_id',
});



3)Use this when you are combining different routes and have to access the param fields in different route
express.Routerr({mergeParams:true});



4) For implictly loading the data in Loading file and be make sure to comment out the functions in middleware('save') of specific User model and fter that remove the comments

   await User.create(users, { validateBeforeSave: false });


   5)To increase the perfomance we have to add more indexes in the database
