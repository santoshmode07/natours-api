This populate is used to embedd the data without actually existing in the database
.populate({
    path: 'guides',
    select: '-__v -passwordChangedAt',
  });

2) We can get access to all the reviews for a certain tour,but without keeping this array of ID's on the tour.
So, think of 'Virtual Populate' like a way
of keeping that array of review ID's on a tour,
but without actually persisting it to the database.
And so that then solves the problem that we have
with child referencing

Instead of this:-
 reviews: [
      {
        type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Review',
      },
    ],

Use this:

tourSchema.virtual('reviews', {
  ref: 'Review',
  foreignField: 'tour',
  localField: '_id',
});



3)Use this when you are combining different routes and have to access the param fields in different route
express.Routerr({mergeParams:true});
